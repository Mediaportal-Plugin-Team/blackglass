## Black Glass

Black Glass HD is a skin for Mediaportal. The skin should be easy to use and has a simple and clear look. I took the Theater skin as design inspiration and the default Mediaportal Blue3wide skin as codebase.
Fanart is supported in every screen.

The skin has been designed to be used from the Basic Home screen. However, it works fine using the standard menu home screen. A stand alone skin editor is available. It lets you edit your favorite basic home buttons and customise the main color of the whole skin.
